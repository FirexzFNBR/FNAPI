# FNAPI
Made with python, FNAPI is a tool that exports some things about the game that are used via an API, its current version is 1.0.0 and we will update it over time.

If there are any issues, talk to firex.pak or spirefnbr on Discord.
If you have suggestions for the program, join our discord and send them to us: 

# FNAPI was made by @FirexFNBR and @SpireFNBR.
